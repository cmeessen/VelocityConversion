# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.1.2] - Unreleased
### Changed
- Use [versioneer](https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer) to
  automatically determine version number from git tags and commits.

### Fixed
- Fix issue #9 where output temperature/pressure were not in the same order as
  the input file. This occurred if the input file was not sorted by depth.

## [1.1.1] - 2021-04-17
### Added
- Version number is defined within `VelocityConversion/__init__.py` and is being
  read when building the documentation and installing via `pip`.
- Added support for pipenv.
- The density for the simple pressure calculation can now be defined by
  declaring the variable `SimpleRho`.
- Function `Convert()` for convenience when using VelocityConversion as a
  Python module.
- Added `UnavailableMethodError` when user want to use pressure- and
  temperature-dependent expansion coefficient (`-AlphaPT`), since this method
  is currently buggy.

### Changed
- Enhanced the documentation.
- Use getter and setter for `UseAlpha` variable.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the csv tables were not copied when using `pip install .`.
- Fixed an issue where pressure would not be computed with the simple method.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-07-16
### Added
- Python 3 support.
- Support for usage of VelocityConversion as a Python module.
- This CHANGELOG.
- Function `DefaultMineralogy()`.
- Added encoding, copyright and license disclaimers.
- Added option `-dT` to manually adjust the temperature stepping.
- Added option `-scaleV` to apply a scaling factor to the input velocities.
- Added warning if velocities are in km/s instead of m/s.
- Added LoadArray().
- Added tests with unittest.

### Changed
- The function `CalcPT()` was improved. Instead of manually performing the
  linear interpolation value by value, it now uses numpy.interp(). This allows
  to interpolate all velocities of a depth value at once, and is therefore much
  more performant.
- Updated README.md.
- Migrated from pep8 to pycodestyle.
- Fixed a bug in clearing depth values beyond the stored AK135 values.

## [1.0.1] - 2017-06-22
### Added
- DOI.

### Changed
- Updated README.md and code documentation.

## [1.0.0] - 2017-05-11
### Added
- Initial release.
