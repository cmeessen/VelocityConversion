# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [unreleased] - 2019-06-27
### Added
- Python 3 support.
- Support for usage of VelocityConversion as a Python module.
- This CHANGELOG.
- Function `DefaultMineralogy()`.

### Changed
- The function `CalcPT()` was improved. Instead of manually performing the
  linear interpolation value by value, it now uses numpy.interp(). This allows
  to interpolate all velocities of a depth value at once, and is therefore much
  more performant.
- Updated README.md.
- Migrated from pep8 to pycodestyle.
